THE HIDDEN SMILE

2
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,080
When I sleep at night I often wake up
because of nightmares...

3
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,600
and in my dreams I see how my mother died.

4
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,480
She died when she was going to buy
something in a shop...

5
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,080
I was slowly following her because I wasn't
wearing any shoes.

6
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,280
When she crossed the main road a car ran her over.

7
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,120
So she fell to the floor and all her guts were out...

8
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,640
and all the things she held in her hands flew
all over the place.

9
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,240
So when I remember this kind of things
I throw money into the air.

10
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,440
Hey.

11
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,880
What do you want?

12
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,720
I'm looking for a place to sleep.

13
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,160
Where are you from?

14
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,000
Mekele.

15
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,440
Do you have any family?

16
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,040
No, my parents are dead.

17
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,840
If you want to sleep here you'll have to pay.

18
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,640
How much?

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,080
Show me how much you got.

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,880
Now, just go away and don't come back.

21
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,840
Give me back my money.

22
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,080
Go away!

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,840
I said go away!

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
-Please, give me back my money.
-Go away!

25
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,480
I don´t  have anything left, please...

26
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,560
Go!

27
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,840
Go!

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,320
If I see you again I'll smash your head with this stick.

29
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,440
I used to live in Mekele with my stepmother because I don't
have my own parents anymore.

30
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:57,480
My stepmother hit me every day so one night I decided  to steal
150 birr and ran away from home.

31
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,720
I was looking for a truck going to Addis Abeba
and I found one.

32
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,040
I hid inside the truck´s trailer...

33
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,600
the trailer was so full that it was going dead slow
so it was easy to run and hide in it.

34
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,920
And that's how I arrived to Addis Abeba.

35
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,480
And ended up in the streets...

36
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,200
Let's finish this chat and go find some business for the night.

37
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,400
How do you feel now? Are you still high?

38
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,840
Not so much, but yesterday it was huge, men...

39
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,880
My friend stole lot´s of money...

40
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,880
How did he do it?

41
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,520
He was begging so a guy took out
1 birr from his pocket...

42
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,320
and accidentaly dropped 100 birr...

43
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,280
Inmediately he stepped on the bill
and he took the 1 birr from him so he made 101.

44
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,320
And do you know what he did with the money?

45
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,880
He fucked all night with Bikina.

46
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,320
Hey guys, do you know this kid?

47
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,640
Yeah, I know him. One of my friends tried to steal
money from him, the kid told the police so they beat him.

48
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,520
I think I saw 50 birr on his hand.

49
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Really?
It could be enough for our party tonight.

50
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,840
Call him.

51
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,720
Hey, kid!

52
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:59,360
Hey you! Yes, yes, you!
Come here, we want to talk to you!

53
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,960
Closer!

54
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,040
Show us what you got, kid!

55
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,640
Search his pockets!

56
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,480
Shut up and show us what you have!

57
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,360
I don't have anything.

58
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,840
Where is the fucking money?

59
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,080
I don't have anything, I'm telling you!

60
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,240
Just leave me alone, the other kids took the money.

61
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,040
Which kids took your money, tell us!

62
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,640
Just leave me alone, ok?

63
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,280
Hey, just leave the kid alone!

64
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,000
Do you have any problem with us?

65
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,320
You know that he's living with us, why are you doing this?

66
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,920
Liar! we don't know this kid, we haven't seen him before, he's new!

67
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,160
This kid was in this place even before you were!

68
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,320
Be careful! you don't have the power to protect him!

69
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,240
Come on, let´s go.

70
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,360
We´ll be watching you!

71
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,120
Hey kid! Give us back the stick!

72
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,960
Hey, kid, give it to us,
can't you see he can't walk without it!

73
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,160
Give me back my money then, I don´t have anything.
Can´t you see that?!

74
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,280
We don´t have anything either!

75
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,920
I don't have any family.

76
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,600
Neither do us!

77
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,760
I'm going to sell the stick to get some food.

78
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,320
Sell it? Give it back to me now!

79
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,520
He cannot walk without the stick!

80
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,560
- Give back the stick!
- We're going to beat you up!

81
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,400
