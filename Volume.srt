1
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,000
By the end of summer, people seemed to lose interest.

2
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,100
Everyone had been holding their breatch
once they stopped talking.

3
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,140
But you can oly hold it for so long I s'pose.

4
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,080
People have their own problems. . Even here.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,120
No more speculations. . No more tears or
neighbourhood search parties. .

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,100
Girls like her seem to come from somewhere else. .

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,040
The way she moved. .

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,200
Like an alien. . Living in that pool.

9
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,080
Georgina.

10
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,000
Her parents turned her room upside down.

11
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,040
But all they found was a diary

12
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,060
containing daily lists of the food she ate,
and how far she'd swam.

13
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,120
Or so I heard.

14
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,160
When you don't know,
truth is just what you decide it is.

15
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,220
And she never came back to tell us otherwise.

16
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,260
She couldn't speak English at all yeah.

17
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,720
The only thing she could say was ''I love you''.

18
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,060
So basically yeah, I fucking turned her around. .

19
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,000
Johnny went to Thailand for two weeks.

20
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,400
He met a girl.

21
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,080
They danced to techno on the beach
and fucked every night.

22
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,820
He can last 45 minutes now.

23
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,580
A half in football lasts 45 minutes.

24
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,160
You know what I mean !
He don't, he's a virgin in he ?

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,080
How about then. . How about. .
Let's say. . Barbara Windsor. .

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,280
Fuckin' look at that !

27
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,100
Come on man, come on !

28
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,400
Where'd you get that from ? !

29
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Give us a go !

30
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,600
Sorry, what ?

31
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,680
You might want to put a hat on !

32
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,400
Thank you Mrs. Woods.

33
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,240
Some of the guys say you have to ignore girls you like.

34
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,020
I can't.

35
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,580
It's like a car crash, or a drunk shouting in the street.

36
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,160
You just can't look away.

37
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,300
I want to. .

38
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,840
But I can't.

39
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,920
What ?

40
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,060
Hey.

41
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,360
You hangover ?

42
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,600
Let the boy eat his breakfast.

43
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Weren't you gonna save me ?

44
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
I knew you were playing.

45
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,700
It's like living with dead people
in this house anyway.

46
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,220
They seem all right.

47
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Are yours happy ?

48
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,100
I think so.

49
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,620
Dunno.

50
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,620
Well. . Do they have sex after they fight ?

51
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Uh, forget about it.

52
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,120
If they do I just take my hearing aid out.

53
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,720
What's it like without that thing ?

54
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,540
Like. . Like being underwater. . Sort of.

55
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,720
I read that you have a better chance of sleeping with a girl

56
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,360
if you find an excuse to leave the room. .

57
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,600
So she can undress alone.

58
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,520
It's the undressing bit that's uncomfortable
about getting naked.

59
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
That's why doctors pull a curtain.

60
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,160
One. .

61
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,500
. . Two. .

62
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
. . Three. .

63
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,640
At the bottom, she wanted to tell me a secret
in exchange for one of mine.

64
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
Only had the one.

65
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,400
I don't even think it was a secret.

66
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,680
Mrs. Phillips came by the house. Said you
promised to do her rose-bushes

67
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,020
You should keep your promises.

68
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,340
Hey. . How you doing ?

69
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,740
Hello !

70
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,960
What's his name then Clare ?

71
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,940
Oh come on !

72
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,940
I told you. You've forgotten.
I'm not telling you again.

73
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,980
Does she has a man ?
<i>- She hasn't got one. She's never. .</i>

74
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,740
She's never had one.
<i>- Right</i>

75
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,780
I just wanna say…
<i>-Speech !</i>

76
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,060
It's not a speech. It just wanna say. .

77
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,380
. . That family is important. And. .

78
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,400
To be able to get to your twenty year anniversary. .

79
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,520
Eighteen hon.

80
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,060
Whatever. . It's not nothing.

81
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,200
And. . Well I just don't know how you do it.

82
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Thank you Clare, that's very nice.

83
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,540
To the family.

84
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,580
Family.

85
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,080
Are they under the table ? -<i>No. </i>
Look under the table.

86
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,980
Ah, what colour are they ?

87
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,160
Well they're brown - like the carpet !

88
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,000
Maybe you came without the shoes.

89
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,200
I didn't come without shoes !

90
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,260
Is this them ?
<i>- No !</i>

91
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Oh there they are !

92
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,660
Let's get you a cab.

93
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,700
You start loading. I'll get the rest.

94
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,020
Take these up, okay ?

95
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,060
Hi.
<i>- Hi.</i>

96
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Hi. What are you doing here ?

97
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,360
Just visiting Sam, the door was open. .

98
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Hi.
<i>- Hi.</i>

99
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,220
I'm sorry.

100
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,960
Wouldn't it be funny if they
thought that we were doing it ?

101
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,100
Uh, come on Sam, don't look so serious.

102
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,020
I auditioned for a school play once,
only for a small part.

103
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
The director said I wasn't convincing.

104
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,020
I have to go.

105
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,000
She gave the part to someone else.

106
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,100
Um. . Could you walk me out ?

107
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,040
What time ? You don't know what
you are talking about. .

108
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Congratulations Georgina. Well done.

109
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,420
Say it to the girl who won.

110
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,300
You've disrespected the family and upset your mum.

111
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,540
We. . We were just. .

112
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,340
Do you understand, Samuel ?
<i>- Yes.</i>

113
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
There's lemonade inside.

114
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
I think I should maybe finish. .

115
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
. . Finish the leaves. .

116
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,020
Cheers.

117
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,020
The garden looks wonderful Sam.
Thank you.

118
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,020
Yeah.

119
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,060
I'd better go and finish the pool.

120
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,720
Maybe she was showing Dad
what we were doing the other day.

121
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,380
But it didn't sound like a joke anymore.

122
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Maybe Dad joined in.

123
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,700
Found it funny.

124
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,260
Maybe he told her I was a virgin.

125
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,140
They probably laughed about it.

126
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,080
I bet he made her come.

127
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,560
Maybe they smoked cigarettes afterwards.

128
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,380
They do in films.

129
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,120
Except in porn.

130
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Porn just ends.

131
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,100
My baby boy.

132
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,540
Growing up so fast.

133
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,340
Girls don't just disappear.

134
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,960
What if he strangled her to death
in one of those sex games.

135
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,940
You all right ?

136
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,760
Maybe when Geogina's dad came by that night. .

137
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,700
. . Dad lied.

138
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Maybe Mum knew.

139
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,000
What did you do Dad ?

140
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,100
What did you do Dad ?

141
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
What did you do Dad ?

142
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,240
What's wrong with you ?

143
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,260
Or maybe I just imagined the noise.

144
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,060
Maybe Georgina ran away. .

145
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,300
Got tired of her parents and swimming
and school and all that.

146
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,840
She could be on a beautiful beach somewhere.

147
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,840
Eating with her hands. .

148
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,480
Dancing around the fire. .
And skinny-dipping in the ocean.

149
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,940
Maybe she's in love with a guy
who can last 45 minutes.

150
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,660
45 minutes. .

151
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:50,055
That sounds like a long time.
