1
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,000
By the end of summer, people seemed to lose interest.

2
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,150
Everyone had been holding their breatch
once they stopped talking.

3
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,140
But you can oly hold it for so long I s'pose.

4
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,080
People have their own problems .. even here.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,110
No more speculations .. no more tears or
neighbourhood search parties ..

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,100
Girls like her seem to come from somewhere else ..

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,030
The way she moved ..

8
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,200
Like an alien .. living in that pool.

9
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,080
Georgina.

10
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,045
Her parents turned her room upside down.

11
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:37,050
But all they found was a diary
Her parents turned her room upside down.

12
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,045
But all they found was a diary

13
00:01:39,103 --> 00:01:43,050
containing daily lists of the food she ate,
and how far she'd swam.

14
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,120
Or so I heard.

15
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,160
When you don't know,
truth is just what you decide it is.

16
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,220
And she never came back to tell us otherwise.

17
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,307
She couldn't speak English at all yeah.

18
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:23,729
The only thing she could say was ''I love you''.

19
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,080
So basically yeah, I fucking turned her around ..

20
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,000
Johnny went to Thailand for two weeks.

21
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,447
He met a girl.

22
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:35,081
They danced to techno on the beach
and fucked every night.

23
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,810
He can last 45 minutes now.

24
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:42,631
A half in football lasts 45 minutes.

25
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:42,644
You know what I mean!
He don't, he's a virgin in he?
A half in football lasts 45 minutes.

26
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:45,200
You know what I mean!
He don't, he's a virgin in he?

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,213
How about then .. how about..
let's say .. Barbara Windsor ..
You know what I mean!
He don't, he's a virgin in he?

28
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:50,073
How about then .. how about..
let's say .. Barbara Windsor ..

29
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:52,313
Fuckin' look at that!

30
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:52,321
Come on man, come on!
Fuckin' look at that!

31
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:54,118
Come on man, come on!

32
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,448
Where'd you get that from?!

33
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:55,453
Give us a go!
Where'd you get that from?!

34
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:57,448
Give us a go!

35
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,640
Sorry, what?

36
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:47,660
You might want to put a hat on!
Sorry, what?

37
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,687
You might want to put a hat on!

38
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,406
Thank you Mrs. Woods.

39
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:14,231
Some of the guys say you have to ignore girls you like.

40
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,020
I can't.

41
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:23,619
It's like a car crash, or a drunk shouting in the street.

42
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,169
You just can't look away.

43
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:31,295
I want to..

44
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:32,845
But I can't.

45
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,920
What?

46
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:01,056
Hey.

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,399
You hangover?

48
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,609
Let the boy eat his breakfast.

49
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,001
Weren't you gonna save me?

50
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,751
I knew you were playing.

51
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:26,691
It's like living with dead people
in this house anyway.

52
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:31,228
They seem all right.

53
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Are yours happy?

54
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:37,130
I think so.

55
00:06:37,134 --> 00:06:38,620
Dunno.

56
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:42,611
Well .. do they have sex after they fight?

57
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Uh, forget about it.

58
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,110
If they do I just take my hearing aid out.

59
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,721
What's it like without that thing?

60
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:00,549
Like .. like being underwater .. sort of.

61
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,755
I read that you have a better chance of sleeping with a girl

62
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:12,761
if you find an excuse to leave the room ..
I read that you have a better chance of sleeping with a girl

63
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:15,361
if you find an excuse to leave the room ..

64
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,591
so she can undress alone.

65
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:23,529
It's the undressing bit that's uncomfortable
about getting naked.

66
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,090
That's why doctors pull a curtain.

67
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,151
One ..

68
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,506
.. Two ..

69
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
.. Three ..

70
00:07:55,352 --> 00:08:00,648
At the bottom, she wanted to tell me a secret
in exchange for one of mine.

71
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,150
Only had the one.

72
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,399
I don't even think it was a secret.

73
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,673
Mrs. Phillips came by the house. Said you
promised to do her rose-bushes

74
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,010
You should keep your promises.

75
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:01,389
Hey .. how you doing?

76
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:01,404
Hello!
Hey .. how you doing?

77
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:02,734
Hello!

78
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,009
What's his name then Clare?

79
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:12,017
Oh come on!
What's his name then Clare?

80
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:13,974
Oh come on!

81
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:14,009
I told you. You've forgotten.
I'm not telling you again.
Oh come on!

82
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:15,974
I told you. You've forgotten.
I'm not telling you again.

83
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:17,975
Does she has a man?
<i>- She hasn't got one. She's never ..</i>

84
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:20,741
She's never had one.
<i>- Right</i>

85
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:24,787
I just wanna say ...
<i>-Speech!</i>

86
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:28,069
It's not a speech. It just wanna say ..

87
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,415
.. that family is important. And..

88
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:31,458
to be able to get to your twenty year anniversary ..
.. that family is important. And..

89
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,407
to be able to get to your twenty year anniversary ..

90
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:34,557
Eighteen hon.

91
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:37,060
Whatever .. it's not nothing.

92
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,196
And .. well I just don't know how you do it.

93
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Thank you Clare, that's very nice.

94
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,589
To the family.

95
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:48,607
Family.
To the family.

96
00:09:48,607 --> 00:09:50,589
Family.

97
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:55,085
Are they under the table? -<i>No.</i>
Look under the table.

98
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,002
Ah, what colour are they?

99
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,168
Well they're brown - like the carpet!

100
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:01,000
Maybe you came without the shoes.

101
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,240
I didn't come without shoes!

102
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,250
Is this them?
<i>- No!</i>

103
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Oh there they are!

104
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,695
Let's get you a cab.

105
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:12,700
You start loading. I'll get the rest.
Let's get you a cab.

106
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,695
You start loading. I'll get the rest.

107
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:07,025
Take these up, okay?

108
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,090
Hi.
<i>- Hi.</i>

109
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Hi. What are you doing here?

110
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:23,363
Just visiting Sam, the door was open ..

111
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,190
Hi.
<i>- Hi.</i>

112
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,210
I'm sorry.

113
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,962
Wouldn't it be funny if they
thought that we were doing it?

114
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,092
Uh, come on Sam, don't look so serious.

115
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,011
I auditioned for a school play once,
only for a small part.

116
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
The director said I wasn't convincing.

117
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,020
I have to go.

118
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
She gave the part to someone else.

119
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,100
Um .. could you walk me out?

120
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,040
What time?  You don't know what
you are talking about ..

121
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,030
Congratulations Georgina. Well done.

122
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,416
Say it to the girl who won.

123
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,290
You've disrespected the family and upset your mum.

124
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,556
We .. we were just ..

125
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,333
Do you understand, Samuel?
<i>- Yes.</i>

126
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,030
There's lemonade inside.

127
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,190
I think I should maybe finish ..

128
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
.. finish the leaves ..

129
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:06,021
Cheers.

130
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,020
The garden looks wonderful Sam.
Thank you.

131
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,020
Yeah.

132
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,050
I'd better go and finish the pool.

133
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,719
Maybe she was showing Dad
what we were doing the other day.

134
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,379
But it didn't sound like a joke anymore.

135
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,090
Maybe Dad joined in.

136
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:30,693
Found it funny.

137
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:51,267
Maybe he told her I was a virgin.

138
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,130
They probably laughed about it.

139
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:04,075
I bet he made her come.

140
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:12,560
Maybe they smoked cigarettes afterwards.

141
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:18,389
They do in films.

142
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,110
Except in porn.

143
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,070
Porn just ends.

144
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,100
My baby boy.

145
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:40,533
Growing up so fast.

146
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,334
Girls don't just disappear.

147
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:07,958
What if he strangled her to death
in one of those sex games.

148
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:15,934
You all right?

149
00:21:20,668 --> 00:21:23,762
Maybe when Geogina's dad came by that night ..

150
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:28,693
.. Dad lied.

151
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Maybe Mum knew.

152
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,050
What did you do Dad?

153
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,070
What did you do Dad?
What did you do Dad?

154
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,100
What did you do Dad?

155
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
What did you do Dad?

156
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,230
What's wrong with you?

157
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,263
Or maybe I just imagined the noise.

158
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,060
Maybe Georgina ran away ..

159
00:23:59,294 --> 00:24:02,304
Got tired of her parents and swimming
and school and all that.

160
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:08,832
She could be on a beautiful beach somewhere.

161
00:24:09,474 --> 00:24:11,848
Eating with her hands ..

162
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,481
Dancing around the fire ..
and skinny-dipping in the ocean.

163
00:24:21,145 --> 00:24:25,934
Maybe she's in love with a guy
who can last 45 minutes.

164
00:24:43,822 --> 00:24:46,659
45 minutes ..

165
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:50,055
That sounds like a long time.
