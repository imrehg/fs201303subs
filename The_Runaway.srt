1
00:00:06,935 --> 00:00:09,138
A bill on the floor

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,200
How did it get here
and what destiny awaits it ?

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,200
Sometimes simple questions
don't have simple answers

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,860
Let's see…

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,620
Five main points draw
the area where it all happened

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,600
One : Chewing gum

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,920
We see colour stains on the floor

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,200
but we hardly ever imagine
that every gum, like every bill,

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,320
has an origin and its own history

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,080
A few streets away, a can : 2

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,060
Once bright and new,
it has gone rusty with time.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,820
Like everything in life, I guess

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,900
3 : A car protected by a cover.

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,940
This girl has never seen
what's inside the cover.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,340
Every day she walks by and she imagines
something different inside.

16
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,020
An orchestra…

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,220
Or a karate team
hiding to surprise her

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,280
4 : A dog leash that draws
the finishing line.

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,220
In 1989 the company Dogmatich

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,260
registered its first model, 10ft long

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,040
Today Dogmatic offers a wide range of models,

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,360
like this Dogmatic Maxi with
a retractable leash for strong dogs.

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,800
5 : A knocked out man
in front of a bent traffic light.

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,400
The first time he saw
the word « knocked out »

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,440
was on an Iron Man comic book.

26
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,660
I should also talk
about the three men

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,820
involved in the plot
and the destiny of the bill :

28
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,960
We don't know the identity
of the first yet

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,400
… But we know he must travel

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,400
From here to here

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,760
Drawing a line between the two points

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,320
we find it measures 737ft
and we go through :

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,820
Two streets,
an alley,

34
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,900
a butcher's,
a supermarket,

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,460
another street,
two courtyards,

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,880
a laundry,
a parking lot

37
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,920
and we get
to our final destination.

38
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,300
There waits for him
our second character : Junior

39
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,500
From now on JCT

40
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,000
He is practicing
his face number 3.

41
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,380
Which he learned
from a Lee Marvin movie.

42
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,860
His partner, the third person
involved, is Arturo,

43
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,420
from now on ARC, who waits
for the other two in another car.

44
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,300
Precisely at 12 : 27,
he will turn the ignition

45
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,380
and it will start moving
the cylinders.

46
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,100
There the compression and the spark

47
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,700
will generate a tiny explosion
that will turn the mix into gas,

48
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,100
which will start the engine.

49
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,360
But for now the car doesn't start.

50
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,600
As he waits, ARC is thinking.

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,320
If we could dissect his mind,

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
we would see
dozens of fleeting thoughts

53
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,940
But maybe I am being indiscreet

54
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,840
All those thoughts lead to the present
he has bought for his girlfriend.

55
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,320
Nice bow.

56
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,520
At this very moment
and nine streets away,

57
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,440
a boy is enjoying
a car wash experience

58
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,600
Under the same sky,

59
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,680
small civilisations
live oblivious to these facts :

60
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,340
An ant cruises through a crack
as if it was the Grand Canyon

61
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,100
And a fly soars over a grocery
as if it was the Amazon Jungle.

62
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,860
But I'm digressing.
So much information !

63
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,820
I forgot another element too

64
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,340
6 : A boy that jumps

65
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,120
on a dumped matress.
A few days earlier,

66
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,260
for the first time he didn't feel
like a child when his mother

67
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,300
took him to the junior floor
instead of the children's.

68
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,580
A few feet up, an office worker
pours a glass of water.

69
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,020
This action coincides
with an unexpected spill

70
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,220
And I know I'm digressing,
I know.

71
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,620
But can anyone deny the resemblancd
of that cloud and Richard Nixon ?

72
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,600
A fraction of the time
the cloud took to be formed

73
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,380
takes a cloud of milk

74
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,920
to dissolve
in Albert's cup of coffee

75
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,780
While he waits, Albert watches TV.

76
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,100
The tragedy on the screen
makes him wonder what would happen

77
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,080
if he was in a similar situation
right now.

78
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,300
A less harmful explosion
takes place close to him.

79
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,960
Martin always bursts
the yolk of the egg

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,940
with the cap
of his favourite sandwich.

81
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,980
Beside him, the waiter prepares
a hot chocolate for Roman. ,

82
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,480
who lights another cigarette.

83
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,000
He thinks it's cool to smoke
only half cigarettes.

84
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,820
Let's not judge him.

85
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,200
But let's go back
to the focal point of the plot.

86
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,620
It's almost time !

87
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,600
ARC's thoughts have become. .

88
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,600
. . A bundle of nerves.

89
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,960
Calmer, JCT is engrossed
by a wall stain. .

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
. . That reminds him
of the map of Australia.

91
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,580
I don't know. .

92
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,620
Maybe we don't need so many details.

93
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,040
Didn't it all start with
a very simple question ?

94
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,080
Maybe we will never know
what happened to the bill.

95
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
But… Who really cares ?

96
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:55,579
THE RUNAWAY
