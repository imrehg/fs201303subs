1
00:00:06,935 --> 00:00:09,138
A bill on the floor

2
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:13,246
How did it get here
and what destiny awaits it?

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,238
Sometimes simple questions
don't have simple answers

4
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:18,912
Let's see...

5
00:00:18,908 --> 00:00:22,675
Five main points draw
the area where it all happened

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,067
One: Chewing gum

7
00:00:23,063 --> 00:00:25,383
We see colour stains on the floor

8
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:29,669
but we hardly ever imagine
that every gum, like every bill,

9
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,755
has an origin and its own history

10
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:36,550
A few streets away, a can: 2

11
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:40,521
Once bright and new,
 it has gone rusty with time.

12
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:42,287
Like everything in life, I guess

13
00:00:42,284 --> 00:00:45,365
3: A car protected by a cover.

14
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:47,366
This girl has never seen
what's inside the cover.

15
00:00:48,623 --> 00:00:52,764
Every day she walks by and she imagines
something different inside.

16
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:54,456
An orchestra...

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,641
Or a karate team
hiding to surprise her

18
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:01,735
4: A dog leash that draws
the finishing line.

19
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:04,649
In 1989 the company Dogmatich

20
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:08,748
registered its first model, 10ft long

21
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:11,507
Today Dogmatic offers a wide range of models,

22
00:01:11,503 --> 00:01:14,793
like this Dogmatic Maxi with
a retractable leash for strong dogs.

23
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:19,271
5: A knocked out man
in front of a bent traffic light.

24
00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:21,883
The first time he saw
the word "knocked out"

25
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,873
was on an Iron Man comic book.

26
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,133
I should also talk
about the three men

27
00:01:28,134 --> 00:01:29,282
involved in the plot
and the destiny of the bill:

28
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:32,434
We don't know the identity
of the first yet

29
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:33,866
... but we know he must travel

30
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:35,863
From here to here

31
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:39,238
Drawing a line between the two points

32
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,802
we find it measures 737ft
and we go through:

33
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:44,279
Two streets,
an alley,

34
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:46,370
a butcher's,
a supermarket,

35
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:47,936
another street,
two courtyards,

36
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,354
a laundry,
a parking lot

37
00:01:49,353 --> 00:01:51,353
and we get
to our final destination.

38
00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:54,782
There waits for him
our second character: Junior

39
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:56,970
From now on J.C.T.

40
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:59,469
He is practicing
his face number 3.

41
00:01:59,465 --> 00:02:01,814
which he learned
from a Lee Marvin movie.

42
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:06,335
His partner, the third person
involved, is Arturo,

43
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,932
from now on A.R.C., who waits
for the other two in another car.

44
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:11,722
Precisely at 12:27,
he will turn the ignition

45
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:15,425


46
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:18,875
and it will start moving
the cylinders.

47
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:21,582
There the compression and the spark

48
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:27,182
will generate a tiny explosion
that will turn the mix into gas,

49
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:29,538
which will start the engine.

50
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:32,787
But for now the car doesn't start.

51
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:35,029
As he waits, A.R.C. is thinking.

52
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:37,804
If we could dissect his mind,

53
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,783
we would see
dozens of fleeting thoughts

54
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:43,374
But maybe I am being indiscreet

55
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:49,325
All those thoughts lead to the present
he has bought for his girlfriend.

56
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:50,739
Nice bow.

57
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:53,942
At this very moment
and nine streets away,

58
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:58,865
a boy is enjoying
a car wash experience

59
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,070
Under the same sky,

60
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:04,105
small civilisations
live oblivious to these facts:

61
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:06,763
An ant cruises through a crack
as if it was the Grand Canyon

62
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:13,521
And a fly soars over a grocery
as if it was the Amazon Jungle.

63
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:17,331
But I'm digressing.
So much information!

64
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:20,304
I forgot another element too

65
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:22,813
6: A boy that jumps

66
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:24,599
on a dumped matress.
A few days earlier,

67
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:26,742
for the first time he didn't feel
like a child when his mother

68
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:28,723
took him to the junior floor
instead of the children's.

69
00:03:30,372 --> 00:03:35,007
A few feet up, an office worker
pours a glass of water.

70
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:40,450
This action coincides
with an unexpected spill

71
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:42,644
And I know I'm digressing,
I know.

72
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:47,046
but can anyone deny the resemblancd
of that cloud and Richard Nixon?

73
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:50,086
A fraction of the time
the cloud took to be formed

74
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,853
takes a cloud of milk

75
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:55,347
to dissolve
in Albert's cup of coffee

76
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:57,258
While he waits, Albert watches TV.

77
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,566
The tragedy on the screen
makes him wonder what would happen

78
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:04,507
if he was in a similar situation
right now.

79
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,798
A less harmful explosion
takes place close to him.

80
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:11,437
Martin always bursts
the yolk of the egg

81
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:13,407
with the cap
of his favourite sandwich.

82
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:15,404
Beside him, the waiter prepares
a hot chocolate for Roman.,

83
00:04:15,904 --> 00:04:18,904
who lights another cigarette. 

84
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,467
He thinks it's cool to smoke 
only half cigarettes. 

85
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,287
Let's not judge him. 

86
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,629
But let's go back
 to the focal point of the plot. 

87
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:29,129
It's almost time!

88
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:31,097
ARC's thoughts have become ..

89
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:33,065
.. a bundle of nerves.

90
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:36,429
Calmer, JCT is engrossed 
by a wall stain ..

91
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:38,427
.. that reminds him
 of the map of Australia.

92
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,062
I don't know ..

93
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:42,044
Maybe we don't need so many details. 

94
00:04:42,544 --> 00:04:45,544
Didn't it all start with 
a very simple question?

95
00:04:45,512 --> 00:04:47,512
Maybe we will never know 
what happened to the bill. 

96
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:50,508
But ... who really cares?

97
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:54,008
THE RUNAWAY
