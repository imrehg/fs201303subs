1
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:26,415
Stop that! Why are you doing that?

2
00:00:30,584 --> 00:00:31,367
Stop!

3
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,629
I need to pee!

4
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:33,636
So you have to kill us all?
I need to pee!

5
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:34,968
So you have to kill us all?

6
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:37,173
Come.

7
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:38,519
No!

8
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:39,515
I said "come".

9
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:39,522
No. I don't want her to hurt me.
I said "come".

10
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:41,685
No. I don't want her to hurt me.

11
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:41,692
I'm not gonna hurt you!
No. I don't want her to hurt me.

12
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:43,421
I'm not gonna hurt you!

13
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:48,852
-Spirit, spirit, out!
-Let me go!

14
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:50,578
Out! In the name of Jesus!

15
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:50,585
-Let me go!
-Out! Out!
Out! In the name of Jesus!

16
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,306
-Let me go!
-Out! Out!

17
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,925
The height of disrespect! Do
you have to throw that at me?

18
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:19,965
Medicine will not heal her. I know prayer does.

19
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:23,301
We must find this church today.

20
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:30,363
I got all my eggs in this car. I need to
know where I'm going.

21
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:34,863
Where are you going?

22
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:36,793
Answer me!

23
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:38,694
Just give her her medicine and she'll be fine.

24
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:42,428
It's a spirit!

25
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:44,365
I know it.

26
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,039
How ya doin'?

27
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:54,046
Yeah, I'm kinda a little lost.
How ya doin'?

28
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:55,743
Yeah, I'm kinda a little lost.

29
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:58,561
I'm looking for a church.

30
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:01,122
A church? Which church you looking for?

31
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:04,281
It's not your fault, bless you.

32
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:06,939
Your father never took you home.

33
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,955
Do it this time for me, my blessing?

34
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:11,786
Please?

35
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:13,837
Huh?

36
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,699
I said I need to pee.

37
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:39,580
-Come back.
-The church down the road's about two miles.

38
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,545
You go about two miles back down the road
and you take a right on a dirt road.

39
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:43,560
You go about two more miles and you'll
see the only church we have down here.

Where we goin'?

47
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:32,239
How many steps do you think
it is to get home?

48
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:49,242
You gonna sing?

49
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:07,578
Grandma!

50
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:12,016
Grandma!

51
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:52,196
# Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus #

52
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:57,748
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!
Thank you, Jesus.

Strangers shall submit!

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,677
Is there anybody here that does not know
Jesus, and wants to know him?

00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,812
Anybody else? Don't be shy, if you want
God to touch you today. Hallelujah!
