1
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:26,415
Stop that! Why are you doing that?

2
00:00:30,584 --> 00:00:31,367
Stop!

3
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,636
I need to pee!

4
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:34,968
So you have to kill us all?

5
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:37,173
Come.

6
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:38,519
No!

7
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:39,522
I said "come".

8
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:41,692
No. I don't want her to hurt me.

9
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:43,421
I'm not gonna hurt you!

10
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:48,852
-Spirit, spirit, out!
-Let me go!

11
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:50,585
Out! In the name of Jesus!

12
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:52,306
-Let me go!
-Out! Out!

13
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,925
The height of disrespect! Do
you have to throw that at me?

14
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:19,965
Medicine will not heal her. I know prayer does.

15
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:23,301
We must find this church today.

16
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:30,363
I got all my eggs in this car. I need to
know where I'm going.

17
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:34,863
Where are you going?

18
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:36,793
Answer me!

19
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:38,694
Just give her her medicine and she'll be fine.

20
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:42,428
It's a spirit!

21
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:44,365
I know it.

22
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,046
How ya doin'?

23
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,743
Yeah, I'm kinda a little lost.

24
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:58,561
I'm looking for a church.

25
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:01,122
A church? Which church you looking for?

26
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:04,281
It's not your fault, bless you.

27
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:06,939
Your father never took you home.

28
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,955
Do it this time for me, my blessing?

29
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:11,786
Please?

30
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:13,837
Huh?

31
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,699
I said I need to pee.

32
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:39,580
-Come back.
-The church down the road's about two miles.

33
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,560
You go about two miles back down the road
and you take a right on a dirt road.

34
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:46,251
You go about two more miles and you'll
see the only church we have down here.

35
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:48,536
-Alright. Thank you.
-Yes sir.

36
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:44,366
Are you gonna pee, or what?

37
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:46,003
I'm gonna pee on you.

38
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:47,495
Yeah right.

39
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:20,087
Where we goin'?

40
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:32,239
How many steps do you think
it is to get home?

41
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:49,242
You gonna sing?

42
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:07,578
Grandma!

43
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:12,016
Grandma!

44
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:52,196
# Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus #

45
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:57,748
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!
Thank you, Jesus.

46
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:05,651
In the name of Jesus
Holy Ghost fire

47
00:06:08,163 --> 00:06:09,829
Let him go right now.

48
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:11,937
Let him go! Let him go!
Let him go! Let him go!

49
00:06:11,926 --> 00:06:13,581
In the name of Jesus!

50
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,842
The word of God says strangers...

51
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:17,426
Strangers shall submit!

52
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:20,100
They shall be afraid out of
their closed places.

53
00:06:22,694 --> 00:06:25,870
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

54
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:29,929
Holy Ghost fire! Holy Ghost fire!
Right now!

55
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,759
Fire! Fire! Fire!
Holy Ghost Fire!

56
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:36,930
Begin to churn! Begin to churn!

57
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:38,931
Begin to churn! Begin to churn
inside your stomach!

58
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:42,255
Every piece of you vomiting.
In the name of Jesus!

59
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:48,098
Listen. Do this for me. Please.

60
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:51,833
-But!
-Do this for mama.

61
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:57,836
Listen, don't you trust me?

62
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,677
Is there anybody here that does not know
Jesus, and wants to know him?

63
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,835
Anybody else? Don't be shy, if you want
God to touch you today. Hallelujah!

64
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:08,684
Anybody else that wants me to pray for
them? Come! Come! Come! Come! Come!

65
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,085
Come on! Come on! Come on! Bring that
little girl here - she has a bright future.

66
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:15,847
Jesus is willing to set you free, right now.

67
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:18,387
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Bring her here!

68
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:22,260
In the name of Jesus, I command
every foul spirit

69
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:25,759
that is causing you to be rebellious,
to come out of you right now.

70
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:27,965
Right now! Right now! In the name of Jesus

71
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,078
I command you to come out!
I command you to come out!

72
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:32,928
Right now! Come out right
now! Come out right now!

73
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:34,905
In the name of Jesus! Right now!

74
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:39,143
The fire of God! The fire of God!
The fire of God! The fire of God!

75
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:43,369
In the name of Jesus come out right now!
In the name of Jesus come out of her!

76
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:46,773
I call you here, demon. Let her go!
Let her go! Let her go!

77
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,215
The fire of God! The fire of God! The fire of God!

78
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:53,413
Holy Ghost fire! The blood of
Jesus! The blood of Jesus!

79
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:57,439
Holy Ghost fire! Right now! Come out!
Come out! Come out! Come out! Come out!

80
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,953
In the name of Jesus, come out!
In the name of Jesus, come out!

81
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,321
In the name of Jesus, come out!

82
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:03,331
Right now! Right now!
Right now! Right now!

83
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,032
Come out!

84
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:08,236
Lose her body!

85
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:11,763
Now! Now! Now!

86
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:28,393
Hallelujah! Is there anybody here who
wants to accept Jesus today?

87
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:32,009
Today might be your day of salvation! Today
might be your day of delivery!

88
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:36,122
Today might be your day of healing! Come
to the alter! Let God touch you!

89
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,979
Come to the alter! Let God touch you today!

90
00:08:39,973 --> 00:08:42,930
Fire of God! The fire of God!
