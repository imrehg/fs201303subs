1
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,965
I never heard of anybody outside of my circle

2
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:21,093
that knows who he is.

3
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,881
Perhaps there is more to the story than I know.

4
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:37,133
I got my hands on this CD and ..
and became very fond of it right away.

5
00:00:41,462 --> 00:00:44,355
We were just listening to
it at some party in Canada.

6
00:00:45,172 --> 00:00:48,325
After that I was given
a copy of this CD

7
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:54,757
and told the story behind it

8
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:00,425
that made the CD even more interesting.

9
00:01:01,724 --> 00:01:04,223
This story where

10
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:08,027
he was not publishing himself,

11
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:12,164
but someone had sneaked into his locker

12
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:15,296
and a copy of the CD was ..

13
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:17,591
stolen.

14
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:51,789
Daniel C - THE PIRATE OF LOVE

15
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:57,480
Then Helgi gets mesmerized

16
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,720
and he brings the CD to Reykjavik ..

17
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,733
and is obsessed with these songs.

18
00:02:01,745 --> 00:02:03,927
And he basically .. somehow

19
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:11,433
.. introduces these songs to people
and it's just like a rolling snowball.

20
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:15,283
If I remember correctly how I got to know Daniel C,

21
00:02:15,963 --> 00:02:19,143
I first got to hear it from my friend Palli.

22
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,825
It was some guy, soewhere ..
a truckdriver,

23
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:30,651
that had written lots of songs
to the same chick.

24
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:19,397
I know he was supposed to be,

25
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:22,586
or he is, maybe he's still alive,

26
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:28,638
a Romanian immigrant .. in Canada.

27
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,975
And he was a weird guy,

28
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:34,475
reserved, nobody really knew him.

29
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:41,338
The story goes that he's in love with this girl.

30
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:44,557
And was going to send .. her name is Sherry.

31
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,835
and he's gonna send her this CD
as a love confession.

32
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,998
And in the end
she wants nothing to do with him

33
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,846
which I don't understand.

34
00:04:29,874 --> 00:04:32,080
But maybe it's too much
making a whole album.

35
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:34,181
Maybe it would have worked better
if it had only been one song.

36
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:37,435
The he disappears all of a sudden

37
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:41,807
without any .. out of the blue.
Just stops coming in.

38
00:04:43,102 --> 00:04:50,117
Ant they had heard that he had some
trouble because of some woman, or something.

39
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:56,394
I don't think she fell for it.
I think he has ..

40
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:00,159
I don't think they ever got together.

41
00:05:45,157 --> 00:05:49,999
Like I said, these are all just some
rumours and you never really ..

42
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:56,207
neet someone that just knows it for sure.
It's always just like, well there was something

43
00:05:56,707 --> 00:06:00,590
that when he lived in Canada,
he lived with some religious family.

44
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:03,600
They rented him some basement or something,

45
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:06,004
and he starts showing their daughter
some interest,

46
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:10,343
which was a bit too young for him.

47
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:14,233
And just too young for everybody,
if we think about it.

48
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:18,778
But there were some who thought
that it might be her

49
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,778
that he was singing it to.

50
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:26,052
But I don't know.
I have a hard time imagining that.

51
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:28,588
Well yes there is this,

52
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:31,717
''Dogs are barking, cats are meowing''.

53
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:37,372
It's a bit .. well yes, it's not out of the
question that maybe it was written to a ...

54
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:41,014
very young .. woman.

55
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:28,714
Well the thing is that Sherry is

56
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:30,763
a thirteen year old girl.

57
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:33,413
Thirteen year old black girl.

58
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:37,002
That he is supposed to have tricked ..

59
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:43,265
in some sort of communication with him.
And her parents found out

60
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:47,339
and all hell broke loose.
That's why he had to leave town.

61
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:52,623
It was like he had been driven off,
to the United States

62
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:55,905
with a broken heart.

63
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:37,470
But I never got to know
if he knew that the CD was stolen

64
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:39,830
and that it got into some circulation or ..

65
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:43,600
or if they really knew that he was
going to send it to this ..

66
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:47,780
this girl that he sings so much about.

67
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:33,338
I found the CD totally by accident.

68
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:38,507
I found it on a forum
but I don't remember what forum it was.

69
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:44,697
The first one was ''Lonely Life''

70
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:48,542
I was really touched by those songs.
I really liked them.
