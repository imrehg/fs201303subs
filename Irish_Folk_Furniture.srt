1
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:48,857
How come you kept the half door?

2
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,160
Most people got rid of them.

3
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,540
Well ehm… I don't know

4
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,680
… It keeps out hens.

5
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,180
Of course.

6
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,800
You know… And it would keep out a breeze.

7
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,160
You'd have to put up a porch if you took it.

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,300
Yeah, true.

9
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,460
Mmmm.

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,020
And that door I think is there all the time.

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,800
Well it looks it.

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,480
It's a great looking door.

13
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,120
Mmmm.

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,640
So the hens do try to come in ?

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,780
Oh they'd love to come in.

16
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,080
For the warmth ?

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,960
Ah yeah, and ramble around… You know.

18
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,360
And the ducks don't try to come in at all ?

19
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,180
No.

20
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:20,780
No ?

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,960
They're more cautious.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,300
Yeah ?

23
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,880
Yeah.

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,800
Do you ever remember painting the furniture

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,420
for different occasions ?

26
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,120
Well an odd time you would,

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,480
you might paint chairs…

28
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,500
… Although they didn't get any paint.

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,380
Those chairs have been there a while… Have they ?

30
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,080
Yeahhhh.

31
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,680
How far back in your family does this dresser go ?

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,040
Ahmm…

33
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,940
… I reckon it goes back to my grandmother…

34
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,840
Her name was Mary Coen.

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,260
The dresser was in the house

36
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,080
till… Ehm… About…

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,540
…2003.

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
On the very top here

39
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,380
there was 2 Willow pattern dishes.

40
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,200
On this here now there was

41
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,900
two smaller dishes - Willow pattern.

42
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,460
… There was all the mugs hanging along here.

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,340
… On hooks.

44
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,120
The big plates was here…

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,280
… And the small plates was on the bottom

46
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,320
… But there was cups here…

47
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,760
… There was a row of cups here…

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,840
… And a row of mugs below.

49
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,120
Why did it go out ?

50
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Aah… Because Johnny got

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,740
another cabinet…

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,020
… And I got mad.

53
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,640
But you… You had moved out at that stage.

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,440
I had gone… I was gone since

55
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,760
… I was gone since 1973.

56
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,360
Una Costello has a flour bin,

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,240
and my uncle has a flour bin almost identical…

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,000
and they're… They're all done in wood graining.

59
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,200
Oh God, I'd… I'd have made that now.

60
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,480
You would have made the flour bins ?

61
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,240
I would, t'would be

62
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,680
about that height…

63
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,420
… And a little board upon the top.

64
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,420
And a lid this way you could lift up.

65
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,080
Yes… I made that…

66
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,520
Were they a speciality of yours ? …

67
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,540
… The flour bins.

68
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,980
Ah no, you'd just get an order.

69
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,060
At that time mice used to be in the houses.

70
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,100
They were more common that time in old houses…

71
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,200
… And the the

72
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,340
the flour bin was a security.

73
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,540
Hmmm… Aye.

74
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,400
Where was the dresser ?

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,420
It was in the old kitchen at home.

76
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,840
T'was a timber partition behind the dresser.

77
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,160
Myself and my brother Jimmy slept in there behind that.

78
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,440
You know.

79
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,640
The flour bin was over

80
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,020
on the back wall.

81
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,780
Ehm…

82
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,840
I'd say,

83
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,200
I'd say that was made in the late 50's.

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,120
That's quite late for a flour bin -isn't it ?

85
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,020
Yes, yes. The other one was gone,

86
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,420
the lid of it… The hinges were broken…

87
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,520
… And… T'was gone quite old.

88
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,200
I don't know what age t'would be.

89
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:42,100
Projects come in bit by bit… You know.

90
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,120
Mikey Parkinson gave me a tree below in Slevoyre…

91
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,200
… And I said I'd make him a table… Out of the tree.

92
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,700
So when I made one table I made six tables

93
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,000
… And I gave him one of them.

94
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,660
What was the wood ?

95
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,800
Beech.

96
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,000
And was it hard to work with ?

97
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,580
No, beech is very nice… Very easy to work with beech.

98
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,000
I mean for you now… What was
the major problem in terms of restoring the dressers ?

99
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,680
Bad timber

100
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,640
… Old decayed timber… Woodworm.

101
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,440
Ehm,

102
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,900
bad joints…

103
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,380
… Everything very very rustic.

104
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,520
Which… Aah… You'd be inclined to say

105
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,240
« It should be put together better ».

106
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,320
But when it goes… When…

107
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,740
… It's part of the furniture then and you don't mind it.

108
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,820
Tell me what you think of… Ehm

109
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,880
…. This traditional furniture.

110
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,120
Aah, at first I'd have steered clear.

111
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,000
Ehm…

112
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,460
… I'd have sooner started with a fresh piece of timber…

113
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,580
… And worked from scratch

114
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,520
… And make a new piece of furniture.

115
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,100
But ehm… Then when Tony brought the few bits…

116
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,720
and he said sure « there's not much to do »…

117
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,960
and we started going into dressers that
« wasn't much to do on them »

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,800
… And we done a good bit on em.

119
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,480
And they turned out lovely.
And I was amazed myself the way they finished up…

120
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,760
… And the way they turned out…
… And with a small bit of work

121
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,860
… And a little bit… Of attention

122
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,120
how you could bring them back.

123
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,040
Cover it all up with paint afterwards so tis grand

124
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,500
- very forgiving.

125
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,400
But tell me, what is it about them that you like ?

126
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,100
… That you hadn't seen in them before ?

127
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,100
Simplicity I'd say

128
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,760
… Most of it… You know.

129
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,740
And just everything was put together

130
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,060
very, very basically.

131
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,100
No real joints… Ehm… A lot of

132
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,400
… Even nails.

133
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,620
And nails would be rusted out now… Ehm

134
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,020
… Screws would be bigger than what

135
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,740
maybe you should have been using.

136
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,020
Ehm… Everything was so simple.

137
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,940
Just… It fulfilled what its job

138
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,976
… What it had to do in the house.
