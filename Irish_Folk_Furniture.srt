1
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:48,857
How come you kept the half door?

2
00:00:48,854 --> 00:00:51,206
Most people got rid of them.

3
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:53,591
Well ehm... I don't know

4
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:55,732
... it keeps out hens.

5
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:57,220
Of course.

6
00:00:57,213 --> 00:00:58,843
You know... and it would keep out a breeze.

7
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:01,211
You'd have to put up a porch if you took it.

8
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:02,341
Yeah, true.

9
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,490
Mmmm.

10
00:01:03,486 --> 00:01:06,063
And that door I think is there all the time.

11
00:01:06,052 --> 00:01:07,790
Well it looks it.

12
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:09,531
It's a great looking door.

13
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:11,123
Mmmm.

14
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:12,686
So the hens do try to come in?

15
00:01:12,684 --> 00:01:14,818
Oh they'd love to come in.

16
00:01:14,815 --> 00:01:16,125
For the warmth?

17
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,019
Ah yeah, and ramble around... you know.

18
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,407
And the ducks don't try to come in at all?

19
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,213
No.

20
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:20,818
No?

21
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:22,005
They're more cautious.

22
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:22,336
Yeah?

23
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,928
Yeah.

24
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:25,844
Do you ever remember painting the furniture

25
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:28,455
for different occasions?

26
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:30,167
Well an odd time you would,

27
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,523
you might paint chairs...

28
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,500
... although they didn't get any paint.

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,428
Those chairs have been there a while... have they?

30
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:37,074
Yeahhhh.

31
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:46,724
How far back in your family does this dresser go?

32
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:48,091
Ahmm...

33
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:51,987
...I reckon it goes back to my grandmother...

34
00:01:51,974 --> 00:01:53,882
Her name was Mary Coen.

35
00:01:53,872 --> 00:01:56,304
The dresser was in the house

36
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:58,136
till... ehm... about...

37
00:01:58,124 --> 00:02:00,543
...2003.

38
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:04,456
On the very top here

39
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:08,407
there was 2 Willow pattern dishes.

40
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:10,255
On this here now there was

41
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:13,962
two smaller dishes - Willow pattern.

42
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:16,503
...there was all the mugs hanging along here.

43
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:18,387
...on hooks.

44
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,180
The big plates was here...

45
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,337
...and the small plates was on the bottom

46
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:24,378
...but there was cups here...

47
00:02:24,365 --> 00:02:25,810
...there was a row of cups here...

48
00:02:25,803 --> 00:02:27,842
...and a row of mugs below.

49
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,178
Why did it go out?

50
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,219
Aah... because Johnny got

51
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,791
another cabinet...

52
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,026
...and I got mad.

53
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:39,695
But you... you had moved out at that stage.

54
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:41,501
I had gone... I was gone since

55
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:43,768
...I was gone since 1973.

56
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:54,415
Una Costello has a flour bin,

57
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:57,288
and my uncle has a flour bin almost identical...

58
00:02:57,287 --> 00:03:00,058
and they're... they're all done in wood graining.

59
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,257
Oh God, I'd... I'd have made that now.

60
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:03,533
You would have made the flour bins?

61
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:05,301
I would, t'would be

62
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,734
about that height...

63
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:11,464
...and a little board upon the top.

64
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:14,462
And a lid this way you could lift up.

65
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:17,121
Yes... I made that...

66
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,572
Were they a speciality of yours? ...

67
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:19,585
...the flour bins.

68
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:22,019
Ah no, you'd just get an order.

69
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:25,096
At that time mice used to be in the houses.

70
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:28,141
They were more common that time in old houses...

71
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:29,258
...and the the

72
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:31,389
the flour bin was a security.

73
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,536
Hmmm... aye.

74
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:49,473
Where was the dresser?

75
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:53,468
It was in the old kitchen at home.

76
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:55,861
T'was a timber partition behind the dresser.

77
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:59,207
Myself and my brother Jimmy slept in there behind that.

78
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,438
You know.

79
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,714
The flour bin was over

80
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:06,082
on the back wall.

81
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:07,825
Ehm...

82
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:09,891
I'd say,

83
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,258
I'd say that was made in the late 50's.

84
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:14,167
That's quite late for a flour bin -isn't it?

85
00:04:14,152 --> 00:04:17,069
Yes, yes. The other one was gone,

86
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:19,476
the lid of it... the hinges were broken...

87
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,514
...and... t'was gone quite old.

88
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,192
I don't know what age t'would be.

89
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:42,101
Projects come in bit by bit... you know.

90
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:56,170
Mikey Parkinson gave me a tree below in Slevoyre...

91
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,258
...and I said I'd make him a table... out of the tree.

92
00:04:58,242 --> 00:05:00,758
So when I made one table I made six tables

93
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:01,993
...and I gave him one of them.

94
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:07,715
What was the wood?

95
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,853
Beech.

96
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:10,051
And was it hard to work with?

97
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:12,580
No, beech is very nice... very easy to work with beech.

98
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:21,044
I mean for you now... what was
the major problem in terms of restoring the dressers?

99
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:22,734
Bad timber

100
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:25,694
...old decayed timber... woodworm.

101
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:27,486
Ehm,

102
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:28,956
bad joints...

103
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:32,418
...everything very very rustic.

104
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,560
Which... aah... you'd be inclined to say

105
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:38,285
"It should be put together better".

106
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,357
But when it goes... when...

107
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:42,732
...it's part of the furniture then and you don't mind it.

108
00:05:45,986 --> 00:05:47,845
Tell me what you think of... ehm

109
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:50,924
....this traditional furniture.

110
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:54,177
Aah, at first I'd have steered clear.

111
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,051
Ehm...

112
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,511
...I'd have sooner started with a fresh piece of timber...

113
00:05:57,495 --> 00:05:58,627
...and worked from scratch

114
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,568
...and make a new piece of furniture.

115
00:06:00,564 --> 00:06:03,140
But ehm... then when Tony brought the few bits...

116
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:05,773
and he said sure "there's not much to do"...

117
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:09,014
and we started going into dressers that
"wasn't much to do on them"

118
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:10,846
...and we done a good bit on em.

119
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:13,511
And they turned out lovely.
And I was amazed myself the way they finished up...

120
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:15,841
...and the way they turned out...
...and with a small bit of work

121
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:16,906
...and a little bit... of attention

122
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:19,170
how you could bring them back.

123
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:22,099
Cover it all up with paint afterwards so tis grand

124
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,499
-very forgiving.

125
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:40,450
But tell me, what is it about them that you like?

126
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:42,090
...that you hadn't seen in them before?

127
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,149
Simplicity I'd say

128
00:06:44,147 --> 00:06:45,819
...most of it... you know.

129
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:47,797
And just everything was put together

130
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,109
very, very basically.

131
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:53,144
No real joints... ehm... a lot of

132
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:56,442
...even nails.

133
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:58,660
And nails would be rusted out now... ehm

134
00:06:58,657 --> 00:07:00,059
...screws would be bigger than what

135
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:02,748
maybe you should have been using.

136
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,019
Ehm... everything was so simple.

137
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,979
Just... it fulfilled what its job

138
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,976
...what it had to do in the house.
