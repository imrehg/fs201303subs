You know... and it would keep out a breeze.

10
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:01,209
You'd have to put up a porch if you took it.

Yeah, true.
You'd have to put up a porch if you took it.

00:01:12,684 --> 00:01:14,818
Oh they'd love to come in.

22
00:01:14,815 --> 00:01:16,125
For the warmth?

23
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,019
Ah yeah, and ramble around... you know.

24
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,407
And the ducks don't try to come in at all?

25
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,213
No.

26
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:20,818
No?

27
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:22,005
They're more cautious.

Yeah?

29
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,928
Yeah.

30
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:25,844
Do you ever remember painting the furniture

31
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:28,455
for different occasions?

32
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:30,167
Well an odd time you would,

33
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,523
you might paint chairs...

34
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,500
... although they didn't get any paint.

35
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,415
